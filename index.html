			   <p>The Ballon d'Or is an annual football award presented by France Football. It has been awarded since 1956, although between 2010 and 2015, an agreement was made with FIFA and the award was temporarily merged with the FIFA World Player of the Year, and known as the FIFA Ballon d'Or.</p><br><p>However, the partnership ended in 2016 and the award was reversed back to Ballon d'Or, while FIFA also reverted back to its own separate annual award (now named The Best FIFA Football Awards).</p><br><p>Conceived by sports writer Gabriel Hanot, the Ballon d'Or award honours the male player deemed to have performed the best over the previous year, based on voting by football journalists. Originally it was an award for players from Europe. </p><br><p>In 1995 the Ballon d'Or was expanded to include all players from any origin that have been active at European clubs. Finally in 2007 it became a global prize with all professional footballers from around the world being eligible.</p>

			   <h1 class="name">Lionel Messi</h1>
			    <p>Lionel messi bagged 51 goals from 61 appearances, with 16 assists this season. The man himself was a game changer for his side, winning the man of the match 29 times.</p> <br>
			    <p>While his comparisons with Ronaldo will continue to remain a focal point, the 31-year old was heavily backed to win the FIFA World Cup this year.</p><br>
			    <p>With his side failing to achieve the desired result, Messi could be on the verge of being held back for the first time in 11 years, after winning the Ballon d'Or five times.</p><br>
			    <p>Whether the man does win this season or not, there's no denying that he will end up being one of the greatest players of  all time.<p><br>

		    <section class="box4middle">
		 	    <h1 class="name">C.Ronaldo</h1>
		 	    <p>The Portuguese forward did have a great season, winning four trophies with Real Madrid, more notably, the UEFA Champions League.</p><br>
		 	     <p>The Real Madrid sensation also bagged the highest number of goals in the Champions League this season, scoring 15 goals.
		 	     </p><br>
		 	     <p>With 49 goals from 51 appearances this season, Ronaldo could be in a considerable position in being the top three race this season.Considering that he is rumoured to move to Juventus soon, bringing the Ballon d'Or with him would be enlightening for the Italian side.</p><br>

            <section class="box4right">
			     <h1 class="name">Mohammed Salah</h1>
			     <p>In what was one of the most commendable seasons for any individual footballer, Mohamed Salah has single-handedly put his name on the world map.Despite not winning any trophy last season with Liverpool, the Egyptian King looks dead set to achieve greater things with the English side.</p><br>
			     <p>Having scored 48 goals in 57 appearances, with 14 assists, Salah was an influential member in Liverpool's road to the Champions League Final</p><br>
			     <p>The Egyptian player was also influential in catapulting Egypt to the World Cup Finals after 28 years, by scoring a decisive penalty.</p><br>
